# Crazy Cat Lady (Pygame)

A fun 2D game built with Python and Pygame where the player collects cats while navigating platforms, obstacles, and various challenges. This project was created as part of my portfolio to showcase my programming skills, game logic, and problem-solving abilities.

## Game Overview

- **Player Movement:** Use the arrow keys to move and space to jump.  
- **Goal:** Collect as many cats as possible.  
- **Scoring:** Each cat collected increases your score.  
- **Gameplay Mechanics:** Includes collision detection, platform physics, and random cat spawning.  

## How to Run

1. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  
2. Install dependencies: pip install pygame
3. Run the game: python main.py


## Features

- Smooth player movement and jumping  
- Random cat spawning with collision detection  
- Score tracking and simple game logic  
- Sound effects and visual feedback  
- Expandable structure for future features  

## What I Learned

- How to use Pygame’s game loop and event system  
- Handling collisions and sprite interactions  
- Managing spawning, scoring, and game state  
- Debugging timing, randomness, and user input  
- Organizing project files for a working game
